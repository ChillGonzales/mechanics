# Mechanics

Full OpenGL implementation of a set of game mechanics.

No plans on making it into a game yet, mainly treating it as a sandbox to learn OpenGL.

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `mechanics.sln` file using Visual Studio 2019.
3. Make sure the active solution platform is `x64` by setting the dropdown at the top of Visual Studio.
4. Build and run the solution using Visual Studio.
